# STRUCTURAL-HEALTH-MONITORING-SYSTEM-NM
System
üèóÔ∏è Introduction


Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is a technique used to assess the integrity and performance of civil infrastructure such as bridges, buildings, and tunnels. This project focuses on using sensor data, machine learning algorithms, and visualization tools to monitor structural behavior and detect potential damage or deterioration in real time or through periodic assessments.

üéØ Objective


The primary objectives of this project are:

To collect and analyze sensor data from structural elements.

To detect anomalies and predict potential failures using machine learning.

To visualize real-time health indicators of the structure.

To provide an early warning system for maintenance and safety evaluation.

üìä Data Source


Simulated data generated using finite element models (e.g., using ANSYS or ABAQUS).

Real-world SHM datasets (e.g., from IASC-ASCE Structural Health Monitoring Benchmark).

Sensor logs from accelerometers, strain gauges, and displacement meters.

CSV, JSON, or time-series formats depending on the data acquisition system.

üõ†Ô∏è Technology Used


Programming Languages: Python, MATLAB (optional)

Libraries & Tools:

NumPy, Pandas for data processing

Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly for visualization

scikit-learn, TensorFlow or PyTorch for machine learning

Flask or Streamlit for dashboard deployment

Docker for containerization (optional)
